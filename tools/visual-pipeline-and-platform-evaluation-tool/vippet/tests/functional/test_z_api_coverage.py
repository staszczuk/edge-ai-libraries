"""API route coverage check for the VIPPET functional test suite.

This module verifies that every HTTP endpoint declared in the live OpenAPI spec
has been called at least once during the current pytest session.  Because it
relies on calls accumulated by the shared ``http_client`` fixture (see
``conftest.py``), it **must execute after all other test files** – the ``z_``
prefix in the filename guarantees that when pytest collects tests in
alphabetical order.

When to run
-----------
Run it as part of the full test suite::

    make test-full

Excluded routes
---------------
Routes listed in ``_COVERAGE_EXCLUDED_ROUTES`` are known to require special
hardware or a specific runtime environment that is not available in the
standard test setup (e.g. a physical camera for ONVIF profile discovery).
They are deliberately skipped by this check.  **Any new exclusion must include
an inline comment explaining why it cannot be covered by an automated test.**
